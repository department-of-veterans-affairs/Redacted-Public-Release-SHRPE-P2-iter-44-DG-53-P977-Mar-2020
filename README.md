Repository containing the CIF submission for Suicide High Risk Patient Enhancements Phase 2, iter 44, DG_53_P977 received March 2020.
The National Mental Health Service requires an IT solution that facilitates the delivery of care to Veterans at high risk for suicide. Currently, the VA provides limited emergent care to certain former service members with Other Than Honorable administrative discharge from the military that have not gone through Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) adjudication. This IT solution will enhance VistA so that former service members with OTH administrative discharge and their eligibility for emergency mental health care services are identifiable in the electronic health record and VA staff can track the former service members status within a 90-day episode of care thus providing much needed mental health care and reducing the risk of suicide and other adverse behaviors among this population.
